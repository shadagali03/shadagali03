### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Sarang Hadagali** and I am currently working at **Merck** as a Software Engineering Intern. I started my career at **Tektronix** as a Software Engineering Intern as well where I updated the products page using **mustache.js** and created documentation for various components I implemented. I have also spent time at school working as a **Software Developer Analyst** for **Stevens Student Managed Investement Fund (SSMIF)** where I implemented the front-end views of the risk screen and correlation matrix using **Dash**.
